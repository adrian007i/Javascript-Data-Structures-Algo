BFS
    - good to find the shortest path
    - memory intensive
    - BFS checks all connected nodes before moving on to the next nodes

DFS
    - good to check if a path exist
    - deep graph can be slow
    - less memory
    - DFS goes deep and back tracks when the destination node isnt found


SHORTEST PATHS ALGOS FOR WEIGHTED GRAPHS

BELMANS-FORD
    - Works with negative weights
    - can be slow
    - worst case o(N^2)

DIJKSTRA
    - faster than BELMANS
    - cannot work with negatives
