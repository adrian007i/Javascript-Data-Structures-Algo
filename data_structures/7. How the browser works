Javascript V8 engine

Memory heap
    - defining variables fills up the memory heap
    - Memory leaks occure when a variable is there but not being used
    - avoid global functions



Call stack
    - reads and execute the script
    - pops from call stack after execution
    - js single threaded
    - js one call stack


Javascript run-time environment
    - Javascript (memory heap and call stack)
    - Web APIs (Dom, Ajax, Timeout) - placed from call stack into web APIs
    - callbacks queue checks to see if the call stack is empty to execute
